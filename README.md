👋 Hi, I’m Suraj

<!---
- I'm a creative Front-End Developer passionate about building beautiful, responsive, and user-centric web applications.
- 👀 I’m interested in the entire front-end spectrum, especially modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**. I enjoy turning design mockups into pixel-perfect, interactive UIs.
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering **TypeScript** for more robust and scalable code, and exploring advanced animations with **Framer Motion**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects with a strong focus on UI/UX, or on building beautiful component libraries and design systems.
- 📫 You can see my work on my [**Portfolio**](https://your-portfolio-website.com), or connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile-url).
